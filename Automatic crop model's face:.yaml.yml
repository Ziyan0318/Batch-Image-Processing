Automatic crop model's face:
    1. import tools
        - PIL: handling images (open, resize, crop)
        - cv2(OpenCV): used for pixel-level operations and saving the final results
        - numpy: used to manipulate image data
        -rembg: AI-based background remover
        -facenet_pytorch.MTCNN: a pre-trained face detector model to locate faces in the image
    2. open image
    3. Detect face in the image
    4. IF face is detected:
        -find the face bounding box
        -calculate crop height as 60% of the face
    5. convert image to a format the supports transparency
    6. remoce bg
    7. prepare a blank white canvas of fixed size (1350 x 1800 pixels, w/ RGBA)
    8. measure width and height of the cropped image with transparent bg
    9. calculate x and y offsets to center the cropped image on the canvas
    10. place the cropped image onto the center of the canvas
    11. save the final image to output foler (as PNG)
